Raspberry Pi Signage Scipt v0.1c

Yeah, there's a bunch more options out there for this exact problem I'm solving; they just don't solve our needs. Also yeah, I know this is absolute amateur hour.

Right now you need to edit the variables in the script directly to change directories and such. I'll move this to a .config file eventually to make setup easier.

Requires omxplayer, pqiv, and cifs-utils to work.

If you copy this code, god help you.
